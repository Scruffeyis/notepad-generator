This tool allows you to customize a PDF notepad. I needed a way to organize my notes 
from various meetings, so I developed this to assist me. Below you can customize how 
you would like your PDF file to look. You can then print it out on 
standard 8 1/2 x 11 paper.

** Note: I've moved this code out of my private svn repo so that
anyone who was interested could fork it, download it, and improve it. 
It's been almost six years since I wrote the code so don't go taking it
as an example of my skills. :)
